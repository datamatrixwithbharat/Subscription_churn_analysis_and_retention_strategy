Subscription Churn Analysis & Retention Strategy

🎯 Business Problem (How You’ll Frame It)

“Customer churn directly impacts recurring revenue.
This project identifies churn drivers, segments high-risk customers, and builds an interpretable churn prediction model to enable proactive retention strategies.”

This sounds like a paid consulting engagement.

🔍 Phase 1: SQL Analysis (Product Thinking)
Business Questions


What % of customers churn?


How does churn vary by:


contract type


tenure


payment method


monthly charges




Which segments churn the most?


What behaviors indicate early churn risk?


📌 Output: Churn drivers, not just stats

🔮 Phase 2: Python Prediction Model (Simple & Explainable)
Target
Churn = Yes / No
Recommended model


Logistic Regression (primary)


Decision Tree (secondary)


Key focus (very important):


Feature importance


Odds ratios


Interpretation


💼 Example insight:

“Customers on monthly contracts with high charges and low tenure are 3.2× more likely to churn.”

That’s freelance gold.
